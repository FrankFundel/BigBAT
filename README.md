# BigBAT
Encehancement on the previous BioAcousticTransformer, including semi-supervised pre-training.

# To Do
1. Create new project
2. Prepare data from UFS and re-prepare previous data
3. Fiddle with different overlap and embedding (maybe do that in BAT instead)
4. Semi-supervised pretraining
5. Use GPS and time for prediction
6. Create GUI
